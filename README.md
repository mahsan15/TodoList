# To-Do List React Component

The To-Do List component is a simple interactive application built using React. It leverages the `useState` hook, the `map` function, and Bootstrap styling to create a visually highlighted to-do list.

## Features

- Utilizes the `useState` hook to manage the selected item's index.
- Uses the `map` function to iterate through the to-do items and apply dynamic styling.
- Applies the "active" Bootstrap class to the selected item's list item for visual highlighting.
- Enables event handling with the `onClick` event to update the selected item index.
- Employs conditional rendering to display the list of items or a message based on availability.
